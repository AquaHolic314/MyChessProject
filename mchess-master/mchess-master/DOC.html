<em>mchess2</em>

<h1>Piece representation</h1>
The chess board consists of 64 squares. Each square may be empty or contain a
white or black piece.  Each piece is given an integer value (this is not
related to the <em>worth</em> of the piece in number of pawns).
<p/>
This enumeration is called <em>e_piece</em> and is defined in the file
<em>CMove.h</em>:

<pre>
typedef enum {
    EM = 0,   // Empty
    WP = 1,   // White Pawn
    WN = 2,   // White Knight
    WB = 3,   // White Bishop
    WR = 4,   // White Rook
    WQ = 5,   // White Queen
    WK = 6,   // White King
    BP = -1,  // Black Pawn
    BN = -2,  // Black Knight
    BB = -3,  // Black Bishop
    BR = -4,  // Black Rook
    BQ = -5,  // Black Queen
    BK = -6,  // Black King
    IV = 99   // INVALID
} e_piece;
</pre>

The above is merely an enumeration, and the actual numerical values are
arbitrary. However, I do in the following rely on the fact that:
<ul>
    <li>The empty space has value zero</li>
    <li>All white pieces have positive values</li>
    <li>All black pieces have negative values</li>
</ul>
<p/>
Additionally, I have a special value for an <em>invalid</em> piece. This has
several uses, the foremost will be explained in the following.

<h1>Square representation</h1>
An important function in a chess engine is to be able to generate a list of all
legal moves in a given position. This function is used all the time, and
therefore must be as fast as possible.
<p/>
When writing such a function, one must first consider how to represent the
board configuration, i.e. where each piece is placed, or equivalently, which
piece is on a given square.
<p/>
I've chosen to represent the board as a simple
one-dimensional array of integers. Each index in the array corresponds to a
particular square, and each value in the array is the corresponding piece,
according to the enumeration above.
<p/>
When generating a list of legal moves, it is necessary to check if a piece is
about to move outside the edge of the board. For instance, a rook on H1 can not
move to the right.
<p/>
This is dealt with in a very smart way: The board is <em>enlarged</em>, so that
it is surrounded by two layers of invalid squares. This gives a total of 12
rows of ten squares each, i.e. 120 elements in the array.

<p/>
When testing whether a move is legal, it is enough to test if the target square
is empty or contains an enemy piece. It is not even necessary to exlicitly test
for invalid squares.
<p/>
An enumeration is used to define the index of each square. This enumeration is
defined in the file <em>CSquare.h</em>. This is purely for code readability,
i.e. if I refer to a square as E2 it is more readable, than using the integer
35.
<pre>
enum // Squares
{
    A8 = 91, B8, C8, D8, E8, F8, G8, H8,
    A7 = 81, B7, C7, D7, E7, F7, G7, H7,
    A6 = 71, B6, C6, D6, E6, F6, G6, H6,
    A5 = 61, B5, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, H5,
    A4 = 51, B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, H4,
    A3 = 41, B3, C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, H3,
    A2 = 31, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2, H2,
    A1 = 21, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1,
};
</pre>

<h2>The CSquare class</h2>
It does become necessary to determine the row and/or column number of a given
square, for instance when checking for pawn promotion.  Therefore I've chosen
to write a class <em>CSquare</em> to handle this.  The following is the
essential ingredients:
<pre>
class CSquare 
{
    public: 
        int row() const {return (m_sq/10) - 1;} // returns 1 - 8
        int col() const {return (m_sq%10);}     // returns 1 - 8
        operator int() const { return m_sq; }   // Implicit conversion to integer

    private:
        uint8_t  m_sq; // Internal representation, 0 - 119.
}; // end of class CSquare
</pre>
The conversion operator <em>int()</em> allows the CSquare class to be used
directly as an array index.

<h1>Move representation</h1>
The next to consider is how to represent a move. Obviously, we need an
originating square, and a target square. However, this is not quite enough.
When a pawn reaches the back rank, it may promote to any other piece, and this
must be given as well.
<h2>The CMove class</h2>
The class CMove is used to represent a single chess move.  The essential
ingredients in this class are:
<pre>
class CMove
{
    public:
        CSquare     From(void) const {return m_from;}
        CSquare     To(void) const {return m_to;}

    private:
        CSquare     m_from;
        CSquare     m_to;
        int8_t      m_promoted; // This handles pawn promotion.
}; // end of CMove
</pre>
<p/>
Note the member variable <em>m_promoted</em>. This is only used during pawn
promotion, where it contains the piece that the pawn promotes to. In case of an
ordinary move, the variable is not used, and should be set to zero (empty).
<h2>Enhancements</h2>

This class contains two additional private member variables:
<pre>
        int8_t      m_piece;
        int8_t      m_captured;
</pre>
The first, <em>m_piece</em>, contains the current piece being moved, the second
variable, <em>m_captured</em>, contains the piece being captured, if any.  They
are both used only for printing the current move to the user.


<h2>The CMoveList class</h2>
When generating a list of all the legal moves in a chess position, it becomes necessary to
manipulate lists of moves. I've found it convenient to write a separate class just for this:
<pre>
class CMoveList
{
    public:
        void clear()
        {
            m_moveList.clear();
        }

        void push_back(const CMove& move)
        {
            m_moveList.push_back(move);
        }

        unsigned int size() const
        {
            return m_moveList.size();
        }

        const CMove & operator [] (unsigned int ix) const { return m_moveList[ix]; }

    private:
        std::vector<CMove> m_moveList;

}; // end of CMoveList
</pre>
<p/>
The purpose of this class is just to encapsulate the semantics of an ordinary
array. Here I've chosen to implement the array using the <em>std::vector</em>
container class.
<p/>
When populating the list, the functions <em>clear()</em> and <em>push_back(move)</em> are used.
When examining the list, the functions <em>size()</em> and <em>operator []</em> are used.

<h1>Board representation</h1>
<h2>The CBoard class</h2>
This class is defined in the file <em>CBoard.h</em> and contains all the
information defining the current position on the board. Of course, this
includes the above mentioned array.  Additionally, it includes an integer value
that specifies whether it is the white or the black pieces to move.
<pre>
class CBoard
{
    public:
        void newGame();
        void find_legal_moves(CMoveList &moves) const;
        void make_move(const CMove &move);
        int  get_value();

    private:
        std::vector<int8_t>   m_board;
        int m_side_to_move;
}; // end of class CBoard
</pre>
<p/>
The function <em>newGame()</em> resets the board to the starting position, the
function <em>make_move()</em> updates the board position with the supplied
move, and finally <em>find_legal_moves()</em> generates a list of all legal moves
in the current board position.
<h2>Enhancements</h2>
To improve performance, I've added another member variable that keeps track of
the current material balance.
<pre>
        int m_material;
</pre>
This is kind of like a cache. Instead of
calculating the material balance after each move, it is much faster to check
for captures and promotion, and adjust the current cache incrementally.

<h1>Searching for the best move</h1>
<h2>The AI class</h2>
This class contains an implementation of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
This is a complicated function, and is best described in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">wikipedia</a>
and the <a href="http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Alpha-Beta">chess
programming</a> site.

The class interface is very simple, however:
<pre>
class AI
{
    public:
        AI(CBoard& board) : m_board(board) { }

        CMove find_best_move();

    private:
        int search(int alpha, int beta, int level);

        CBoard&         m_board;
}; // end of class AI
</pre>
Note that the <em>m_board</em> variable is a reference. This is to avoid making copies of the entire <em>CBoard</em> class.

<h1>Final remarks</h1>
These are the basic ingredients necessary to make a working chess engine.
There only remains to write a <em>main()</em> function that instantiates a
<em>CBoard</em> and a <em>AI</em> object. The you must read the user input and
call <em>ai.find_best_move()</em>.
