======

This is a simple (minimalistic) chess engine, but functional never the less.
It is meant as a starting point for writing your own chess engine. Use it for

- A simple console (ASCII) user interface.

Documentation
=============

The design is documented in the file DOC.html.

The source code has comments in most places.  Otherwise, the best place for a high level description is the
above link.
Additionally, the directory doc contains some additional information on writing chess engines.
