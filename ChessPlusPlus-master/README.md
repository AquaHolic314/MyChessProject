ChessPlusPlus is a project by the cplusplus.com commuity aiming to support any and all variants of Chess in modern C++. We want to show the simplicity and elegance of modern C++ as well as demonstrate use of the latest features of the language and the more modern design practices.

Currently we use C++14, so make sure your compiler has good support for it. Known good compilers are GCC 5.2, Clang 3.8, and Visual Studio 2015. Build with CMake 3.3 or later.
